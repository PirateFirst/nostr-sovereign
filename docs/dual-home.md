# Dual-Home Sovereign Relay Architecture

This document freezes intent for the Sovereign Relay dual-home design.

## Canonical Goals
- Public HTTPS access via Cloudflare Tunnel
- Permanent censorship-resistant access via Tor Onion Service
- Single canonical relay identity (pubkey-bound)
- Transport agnostic: HTTPS ≠ authority

## Non-Goals
- Reliance on DNS as a source of truth
- Cloudflare as a trust anchor
- Single-vendor survivability

## Canonical Addresses
- HTTPS: https://sovereign_pathway.sovereignrelay.xyz
- Onion: <to-be-bound>.onion

## Status
Intent frozen prior to provisioning publication.
Implementation follows.
